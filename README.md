# Turbo notepad!
![e4a9136d99ca595a5727c85a091bfdf1](https://github.com/Xyrsto/notepad/assets/73367973/b5e42afd-3415-43a6-9ec8-064fda784f63)

## Why?
Why reinvent the wheel? Because we as engineers like that!
This is a very simple notepad, made as a learning tool to learn Electron, Svelte, Typescript and Tailwind.

## How is the process going?
Hard. Very hard. Since I am not a frontend developer, learning how to design "good" interfaces is very hard.
I do hope that you find the very simple interface somewhat good.

## What do I want to implement here?
Since I am doing a project for university that requires me to change the data of JSON files quite regulary, I want to make sure I have all the proper
highlighting to do that. 
Another thing I want to implement is the possibility to also used this as an actual notepad. You know, to take some notes and stuff. Of course, those notes need to be stored somewhere...
